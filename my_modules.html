<h2>Web Development</h2>
<p>Web development refers in general to the tasks associated with developing websites 
for hosting via intranet or internet. The web development process includes web design, 
web content development, client-side/server-side scripting and network security configuration, 
among other tasks. In a broader sense, web development encompasses all the actions, updates, 
and operations required to build, maintain and manage a website to ensure its performance, user 
experience, and speed are optimal.  </p>


<h2>Computer System</h2>
<p>A computer system is a basic, complete and functional hardware and software setup with everything 
needed to implement computing performance.That’s the basic working definition of the computer system
as we know it, but it has gone through a lot of formal changes over the past few decades.
If that definition on its face sounds kind of abstract, there are some core aspects of computing 
that a computer system has to facilitate. First, there's the ability to receive user input. Then 
there's the ability to process data.</p>

<h2>Database</h2>
<p>A database is a data structure that stores organized information. Most databases contain multiple 
tables, which may each include several different fields. For example, a company database may include 
tables for products, employees, and financial records. Each of these tables would have different fields 
that are relevant to the information stored in the table. Nearly all e-commerce sites uses databases 
to store product inventory and customer information. </p>

    <h2>Digital Footprint</h2>
    <p>A digital footprint is a trail of data you create while using the Internet. It includes
    the websites you visit, emails you send, and information you submit to online services.
    A "passive digital footprint" is a data trail you unintentionally leave online. For example,
    when you visit a website, the web server may log your IP address, which identifies your
    Internet service provider and your approximate location. While your IP address may change
    and does not include any personal information, it is still considered part of your digital
    footprint. A more personal aspect of your passive digital footprint is your search history,
    which is saved by some search engines while you are logged in.  </p>



    <h2>Probelm Solving and Programming </h2>
    <p>This part of the module introduces students to the skills, principles and concepts necessary
    to solve problems in computing. It also aims to develop essential skills to enable the solution
    of these problems with the construction of appropriate algorithms and a computer program. Principles
    underlying the design of a high level programming language will be introduced.</p>


    <h2>Software Engineering</h2>
    <p>Software engineering is the process of analyzing user needs and designing, constructing, 
    and testing end-user applications that will satisfy these needs through the use of software 
    programming languages. It is the application of engineering principles to software development.
    In contrast to simple programming, software engineering is used for larger and more complex software 
    systems, which are used as critical systems for businesses and organizations. </p>
