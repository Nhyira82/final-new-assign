<h2>Web Development</h2>
<p>Web development refers in general to the tasks associated with developing websites 
for hosting via intranet or internet. The web development process includes web design, 
web content development, client-side/server-side scripting and network security configuration, 
among other tasks. In a broader sense, web development encompasses all the actions, updates, 
and operations required to build, maintain and manage a website to ensure its performance, user 
experience, and speed are optimal.  </p>


<h2>Computer System</h2>
<p>A computer system is a basic, complete and functional hardware and software setup with everything 
needed to implement computing performance.That’s the basic working definition of the computer system
as we know it, but it has gone through a lot of formal changes over the past few decades.
If that definition on its face sounds kind of abstract, there are some core aspects of computing 
that a computer system has to facilitate. First, there's the ability to receive user input. Then 
there's the ability to process data.</p>

<h2>Database</h2>
<p>Databases is a hands-on module that applies data modelling techniques to establish, modify
     and maintain data structures and associated components such as entities, relationships and 
     attribute definitions. Students undertake design of a databases applications and translate and 
     implement development requirements into physical database structures using industry desirable 
     software and languages such as Oracle, MySQL and Structured Query Language (SQL). The module 
     highlights the application of industry standards and good practice to optimise employability 
     and performance. </p>

    <h2>Digital Footprint</h2>
    <p>This is a self-managed, online module that considers the data trail and shadow left by 
        interactions in digital environments.  The module shows students how to take responsibility 
        for the integrity and protection of their digital footprint and shadow. The module develops a 
        broad understanding of the impact of individual and organisational online presence in the 
        context of digital marketing, data protection, ethical issues and 
        good practice to optimise employability and prospects.  </p>



    <h2>Probelm Solving and Programming </h2>
    <p>This part of the module introduces students to the skills, principles and concepts necessary
    to solve problems in computing. It also aims to develop essential skills to enable the solution
    of these problems with the construction of appropriate algorithms and a computer program. Principles
    underlying the design of a high level programming language will be introduced.</p>


    <h2>Software Engineering</h2>
    <p>Software engineering is the process of analyzing user needs and designing, constructing, 
    and testing end-user applications that will satisfy these needs through the use of software 
    programming languages. It is the application of engineering principles to software development.
    In contrast to simple programming, software engineering is used for larger and more complex software 
    systems, which are used as critical systems for businesses and organizations. </p>
