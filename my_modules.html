<h2>Web Development</h2>
<p>Web development refers in general to the tasks associated with developing websites 
for hosting via intranet or internet. The web development process includes web design, 
web content development, client-side/server-side scripting and network security configuration, 
among other tasks. In a broader sense, web development encompasses all the actions, updates, 
and operations required to build, maintain and manage a website to ensure its performance, user 
experience, and speed are optimal. It might also, but not necessarily, include all those strategic 
actions needed to ensure its proper ranking on search engine results. Usually, those tasks pertain 
to a different specialization, namely search engine optimization (SEO)Web development is also known 
as website development, while the professionals that maintain a website are called web developers or 
(more commonly) web devs. </p>


<h2>Computer System</h2>
<p>A computer system is a basic, complete and functional hardware and software setup with everything 
needed to implement computing performance.That’s the basic working definition of the computer system
as we know it, but it has gone through a lot of formal changes over the past few decades.
If that definition on its face sounds kind of abstract, there are some core aspects of computing 
that a computer system has to facilitate. First, there's the ability to receive user input. Then 
there's the ability to process data. There's also the capability to create information for storage 
and output. That's a computer system in a nutshell, but understanding what a computer system is also 
involves looking back at the timeline of computer evolution over the decades.</p>

<h2>Database</h2>
<p>A database is a data structure that stores organized information. Most databases contain multiple 
tables, which may each include several different fields. For example, a company database may include 
tables for products, employees, and financial records. Each of these tables would have different fields 
that are relevant to the information stored in the table. Nearly all e-commerce sites uses databases 
to store product inventory and customer information. These sites use a database management system 
(or DBMS), such as Microsoft Access, FileMaker Pro, or MySQL as the "back end" to the website. 
By storing website data in a database, the data can be easily searched, sorted, and updated. 
his flexibility is important for e-commerce sites and other types of dynamic websites.</p>

    <h2>Digital Footprint</h2>
    <p>A digital footprint is a trail of data you create while using the Internet. It includes
    the websites you visit, emails you send, and information you submit to online services.
    A "passive digital footprint" is a data trail you unintentionally leave online. For example,
    when you visit a website, the web server may log your IP address, which identifies your
    Internet service provider and your approximate location. While your IP address may change
    and does not include any personal information, it is still considered part of your digital
    footprint. A more personal aspect of your passive digital footprint is your search history,
    which is saved by some search engines while you are logged in. An "active digital footprint"
    includes data that you intentionally submit online. Sending an email contributes to your active
    digital footprint, since you expect the data be seen and/or saved by another person. The more
    email you send, the more your digital footprint grows. Since most people save their email online,
    the messages you send can easily remain online for several years or more. </p>
