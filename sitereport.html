<h2>Site Report</h2>

<p>My experience in web development, I would say it is very basic from my college 
    days. Even though I have created a website before, this assignment extended my 
    knowledge on HTML and CSS. In the creation of this website, I had many different 
    ideas, but I had to stick to the assignment criteria. Five web pages had to be created, 
    but the way I created my website, I made it in such a way that image holder for the modules. 
    Would be on the home page and when clicked on it. It would redirect the user to the portfolio 
    page, where a brief detail of the modules would be. It was just an extra to the assignment. 
    The idea which would be the website layout and colour scheme was kind based on the logo. The logo 
    was made with a particular colour scheme, so I just had to stick with the same colour. When creating 
    the navigation bar, I had a bit of difficulty the links were not spaced out equally but with help of 
    lecture video I was able to sort it out. I had get used to using a new feature called GitHub, making 
    commit and a branch. When it came to the CSS, sometimes I had to use try and error to make it work. </p>
